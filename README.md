# Remote Provisioning Server

> Disclaimer: Production viable releases are tagged and listed under 'Releases'.  All other check-ins should be considered 'in-development' and should not be used in production

The Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) enables the configuration and activation of IntelÂ® AMT devices based on a defined profile. RPS utilizes the [Remote Provision Client (RPC)](https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/rps) deployed onto edge devices to connect the devices to the [Management Presence Server (MPS)](https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/mps) and enable remote manageability features.


**For detailed documentation** about Getting Started with RPS or other features of the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit, see the [docs](https://open-amt-cloud-toolkit.github.io/docs/).

## Prerequisites

To succesfully deploy RPS, the following software must be installed on your development system:

- [Node.js* LTS 12.x.x or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Management Presense Server](https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/mps)


## Deploy the Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) Microservice

To deploy the RPS on a local development system: 

1. For a local setup, RPS requires an [installed MPS](https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/mps) in the same parent directory. Clone the RPS repository to the same parent directory where your mps directory is located. 

    ```
    ðŸ“¦parent
     â”£ ðŸ“‚mps
     â”— ðŸ“‚rps
    ```

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/rps.git && cd rps
    ```

2. Run 'npm install' from the working rps directory.

    ``` bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run 'npm run dev' start command. The npm run dev start command may take 1-2 minutes to install.

    ``` bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    >Note: Warning messages are okay and expected for optional dependencies.

4. The RPS listens on port 8081. Successful installation produces the command line message:

    ```
    WebSocketListener - RPS Microservice socket listening on port: 8080 ...!
    RPS Microservice Rest APIs listening on https://:8081.
    ```
    
For detailed documentation about RPS, see the [docs](https://open-amt-cloud-toolkit.github.io/docs/)


## Running the API Tests

We leverage [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and Docker for executing RESTful API tests. Once you have Postman and Docker installed, you can follow the steps below:

1) Build the docker image with the following command:
`docker build -t rps-microservice:v1 .`

2) Ensure RPS is running in a docker container with the following command:
`docker run -d -e RPS_HTTPS=false -e RPS_NODE_ENV=dev -e RPS_USE_VAULT=false  -e RPS_USE_DB_PROFILES=false  -e RPS_LOG_LEVEL=silly -p 8081:8081 rps-microservice:v1`

3) Import the test collection located at `./src/test/collections/rps.postman_collection.json`.

4) Run the tests using the Collection Runner in postman. If any of the tests fail, file a github issue here: https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/rps/pull/34
